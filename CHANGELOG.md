## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Change

### Added

### Breaking Change

- The `layouts` and `workspace.layouts` in `config.ron` must be declared as Strings because they are no longer backed by an enum. (ie. use `layouts: ["CenterMain"]` instead of `layouts: [CenterMain]`)
- The `max_window_width` config was removed without direct replacement. The "always fill entire screen" behavior can now be addressed by creating a custom layout with an appropriate `Reserve` property.
- LeftWM now depends on `lefthk` ^0.2.0, which has been refactored (thanks to @blackdragon2447 in #1154)
