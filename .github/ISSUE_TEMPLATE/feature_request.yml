      attributes:
        label: How important is this feature to you?
        description: Please be honest about your answer, this is just to get a feeling. Exaggerating its importance will not automatically make it higher priority.
        options:
          - It is just an idea
          - Would be nice to have
          - My workflow is impaired without it
          - LeftWM is unusable without it

        required: true
    
    - type: dropdown
      id: importance-others
      attributes:
        label: How important do you think is this feature for the average LeftWM user?
        options:
          - I don't know, may be a niche edge-case
          - Would probably be nice to have
          - Their workflow is likely impaired without it
          - No one uses LeftWM because this is missing
      validations:
