          - It is just an idea
          - Would be nice to have
          - My workflow is impaired without it

        label: How important do you think is this enhancement for the average LeftWM user?
        options:
          - I don't know, may be a niche edge-case
          - Would probably be nice to have
          - Their workflow is likely impaired without it
          - No one uses LeftWM because this is missing
