## Floating Windows

You can optionally switch between tiling or floating mode for any window.

| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Mod + MouseDrag         | Switch a tiled window to floating mode  |
| Mod + RightMouseDrag    | Resize a window                         |
| Drag window onto a tile | Switch a floating window to tiling mode |
| Mod + Shift + (1-9)     | Switch a floating window to tiling mode |

## Configuration

***Important: You will need to reload in order to apply any changes you write to `config.toml`.***

### Modkey

The modkey is the most important setting. It is used by many other settings and controls how key bindings work:

Default: `modkey = "Mod4"` (windows key)

### Mousekey

The mousekey is similarly quite important. This value can be used to determine which key, when held, can assist a mouse drag in resizing or moving a floating window or making a window float or tile.

Default: `mousekey = "Mod4"` (windows key)

### Focus Behaviour

LeftWM now has 3 focusing behaviours (Sloppy, ClickTo, and Driven) and one option (focus_new_windows), which alter the way focus is handled. These encompass 4 different patterns:

1. Sloppy Focus. Focus follows the mouse, hovering over a window brings it to focus.
2. Click-to-Focus. Focus follows the mouse, but only clicks change focus.
3. Driven Focus. Focus disregards the mouse, only keyboard actions drive the focus.
4. Event Focus. Focuses when requested by the window/new windows.

Default:

```
focus_behaviour = "Sloppy" # Can be Sloppy, ClickTo, or Driven
focus_new_windows = true
```

### Layouts

Leftwm supports an ever-growing amount layouts, which define the way that windows are tiled in the workspace.

Default layouts:

```toml
layouts = [
    "MainAndDeck",
    "MainAndVertStack",
    "MainAndHorizontalStack",
    "GridHorizontal",
    "EvenHorizontal",
    "EvenVertical",
    "Fibonacci",
    "CenterMain",
    "CenterMainBalanced",
    "Monocle",
    "RightWiderLeftStack",
    "LeftWiderRightStack",
]
```

### Tags

Tags are the names of the virtual desktops were windows live. In other window managers these are sometimes just called desktops. You can rename them to any unicode string including symbols/icons from popular icon libraries such as font-awesome.

Default: `tags = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]`

### Max Window Width

You can configure a `max_window_width` to limit the width of the tiled windows (or rather, the width of columns in a layout). This feature comes in handy when working on ultra-wide monitors where you don't want a single window to take the complete workspace width.

**Demonstration**

Without `max_window_width`

```

With `max_window_width`

|               |               |               |
|               +---------------+               |
+-----------------------------------------------+

                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                MAX_WINDOW_WIDTH
+-----------------------------------------------+
|        +--------------+--------------+        |
|        |              |              |        |
|        |       1      |       2      |        |  [49' monitor]
|        |              |              |        |
|        +--------------+--------------+        |
+-----------------------------------------------+

         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
              MAX_WINDOW_WIDTH * 2
```

This setting can be configured either globally, per workspace, or both. The workspace specific configuration always takes precedence over the global setting.

Values: An `int` value for absolute pixels (`2200` means `2200px`), or a decimal value for fractions (`0.4` means `40%`).
Default: Has no default value. No value means no width limit.

Example:

```toml
# global configuration: 40%
max_window_width = 0.4

[[workspaces]]
y = 0
x = 0
height = 1440
width = 2560
# workspace specific configuration: 1200px
max_window_width = 1200
```
