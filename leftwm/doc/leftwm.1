.IP "check"
This command will run several actions to ensure leftwm is configured properly, this will report the current leftwm version and git commit, it will also check if configuration is loaded correctly, check for syntax errors in your

.\" Configuration section\"
.SH CONFIGURATION
.B IMPORTANT:
You will need to reload in order to apply any changes you write to
.I config.toml

.SS Modkey
.PP
The modkey is the most important setting.
It is used by many other settings and controls how key bindings work:
.PP
Default: \f[C]modkey = \[dq]Mod4\[dq]\f[R] (windows key)
.SS Mousekey
.PP
The mousekey is similarly quite important.
This value can be used to determine which key, when held, can assist a
mouse drag in resizing or moving a floating window or making a window
float or tile.
.PP
Default: \f[C]mousekey = \[dq]Mod4\[dq]\f[R] (windows key)
.SS Focus Behaviour
.PP
LeftWM has 3 focusing behaviours (Sloppy, ClickTo, and Driven) and
one option (focus_new_windows), which alter the way focus is handled.
These encompass 3 different patterns:
.IP "1." 3
Sloppy Focus.
Focus follows the mouse, hovering over a window brings it to focus.
.IP "2." 3
Click-to-Focus.
Focus follows the mouse, but only clicks change focus.
.IP "3." 3
Driven Focus.
Focus disregards the mouse, only keyboard actions drive the focus.
.PP
Default:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
focus_behaviour = \[dq]Sloppy\[dq] # Can be Sloppy, ClickTo, or Driven
focus_new_windows = true
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Layouts
.PP
Leftwm supports variety of layouts, which define the way that windows are tiled in the workspace
.PP
Default layouts:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
layouts = [
    \[dq]MainAndDeck\[dq],
    \[dq]MainAndVertStack\[dq],
    \[dq]MainAndHorizontalStack\[dq],
    \[dq]GridHorizontal\[dq],
    \[dq]EvenHorizontal\[dq],
    \[dq]EvenVertical\[dq],
    \[dq]Fibonacci\[dq],
    \[dq]CenterMain\[dq],
    \[dq]CenterMainBalanced\[dq],
    \[dq]CenterMainFluid\[dq],
    \[dq]Monocle\[dq],
    \[dq]RightWiderLeftStack\[dq],
    \[dq]LeftWiderRightStack\[dq],
]
\f[R]
.fi

.SS Workspaces
.PP
Workspaces are how you view tags (desktops).
A workspace is an area on a screen or most likely the whole screen.
in this areas you can view a given tag.
.PP
Default: \f[C]workspaces = []\f[R] (one workspace per screen)
.PP
Example (two workspaces on a single ultrawide):
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[[workspaces]]
y = 0
x = 0
height = 1440
width = 1720
\f[R]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
[[workspaces]]
y = 0
x = 1720
height = 1440
width = 1720
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Or with short syntax:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
workspaces = [
    { y = 0, x = 0, height = 1440, width = 1720 },
    { y = 0, x = 1720, height = 1440, width = 1720 },
]
\f[R]
.fi

.SS Tags
.PP
Tags are the names of the virtual desktops where windows live.
In other window managers these are sometimes just called desktops.
You can rename them to any unicode string including symbols/icons from
popular icon libraries such as font-awesome.
.PP
Default:
\f[C]tags = [\[dq]1\[dq], \[dq]2\[dq], \[dq]3\[dq], \[dq]4\[dq], \[dq]5\[dq], \[dq]6\[dq], \[dq]7\[dq], \[dq]8\[dq], \[dq]9\[dq]]\f[R]
