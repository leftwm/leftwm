This is a very basic README, merely containing a bunch of heads-up notes for using `eww` with `leftwm`

Important:
Copy the `eww-bar` folder to `~/.config/eww/` otherwise every `eww` command needs to pass the path to the folder where the `eww.yuck` and `eww.scss` files are located.
It is also possible to symlink instead of copy, though `eww` isn't to happy about this and will log some errors, even though working just fine.

The legacy eww example was removed here. If you are still using that, pleas refer to the [leftwm-contrib repo](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm-contrib/tree/main/examples/basic_eww/legacy_eww_xml_config).

Since `eww` is still rapidly changing, if stuff breaks please check their [github](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) for documentation on changes and existing issues.
