Important note:
Copy the `eww-bar` folder to `~/.config/eww/` otherwise every `eww` command needs to pass the path to the folder where the `eww.xml` and `eww.scss` files are located.

Since `eww` is rapidly changing at this times, if stuff breaks please check their [github](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) for documentation on changes and existing issues.
